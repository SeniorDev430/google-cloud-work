CloudCats is an example of using node.js and various Google Cloud APIs and services to solve the greatest question of our time:  do developers prefer dogs or cats.

__This is an adaptation of the [awwvision][awwvision], which uses [Kubernetes][kubernetes] to do something similar.  Credit to [Thea Flowers][thea] for the idea.__

## How it works

Cloud Cats queries for a list of images from the front page of [r/aww][raww].  Each of those images is saved into [Google Cloud Storage][storage], and then analyzed using the [Google Cloud Vision API][vision].

![Architectural diagram][how-it-works]

Cloud Cats uses a few Google Cloud APIs and Services.

- Users visit the front application, which is running in an [App Engine][appengine] module.
- When you're ready to do a run, the {+} will call an endpoint on the [worker][/worker] module.
- The worker will invoke the [Reddit JSON API][reddit] to get a list of images from [r/aww][raww].
- Images are saved to [Google Cloud Storage][storage].
- The [Cloud Vision API][vision] analyzes the image, and tags it as dog or cat or other.
- The result is placed in a [Google Cloud Pub/Sub][pubsub] topic.
- The front end App Engine Module subscribes to results from the topic.
- Results are streamed to the user using [PubNub][pubnub].


## Deployment

This code is built as a demo for running [Node.js on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs), but you can run it anywhere that node.js works.

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. [Enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/settings) for your project.
1. Enable Storage, PubSub, and Cloud Vision APIs in the API Manager.
1. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).
1. Deploy with `gcloud preview app deploy web/app.yaml worker/app.yaml --project <YOUR PROJECT>`
